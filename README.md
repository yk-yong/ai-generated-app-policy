# AI Generated App Policy

Policy / rules that I defined in README to generate a project and asking AI Assistant to follow.

```
**MUST FOLLOW:**

- When implementing a feature that involves third-party services, always create a service layer that abstracts the third-party API. This allows for easier testing and future changes to the service without affecting the rest of the application.
- Use a modular architecture to separate concerns, making the codebase easier to maintain and extend.
- Open/Closed Principle, open for extension and closed for modification. (To test it out)

**Frontend Rules:**

- Write component in reusable and separate of concerns. Focus on composition.
- Single responsibility component. (To test it out)
- Keep component versioned control, create new component whenever introduce new changes. (To test it out)
```
