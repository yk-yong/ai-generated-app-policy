# New Feature Policy

## New Feature Guidelines

1. Before starting the implementation of a new feature, create a detailed plan that outlines the feature's requirements, user stories, and acceptance criteria. This helps in maintaining focus and avoiding scope creep.
2. List down all the tasks required to implement the feature as checklist items. This helps in tracking progress and ensuring that nothing is overlooked.
3. If the project uses Git, create a new branch for the feature development. This allows you to work on the feature independently and makes it easier to manage changes.
