# Refactoring Policy

## Refactoring Guidelines

1. **Use a version control system**: If you are using Git, create a new branch for your refactoring work. This allows you to track changes and revert if necessary.
2. **Make a copy of the file**: Always create a copy of the file you are about to refactor. This ensures that you have a backup in case something goes wrong.
3. **Make a plan**: Before starting the refactoring process, outline the changes you want to make in a markdown file. This helps in maintaining focus and avoiding unnecessary changes.
4. **Refactor in small steps**: Break down the refactoring process into small, manageable steps. This makes it easier to test and verify each change.
5. "If the file is large, consider breaking it down into smaller modules or components. This improves readability and maintainability."
6. "If you are refactoring a function or method, ensure that it has a single responsibility. This makes it easier to understand and test."
7. "If you are refactoring a class, consider applying the Single Responsibility Principle. Each class should have one reason to change. Extend the class if necessary, but avoid modifying it directly."
8. "If you are refactoring a component, ensure that it is reusable and follows the principles of composition."
9. "If you are refactoring a service, ensure that it abstracts third-party APIs and provides a clear interface for the rest of the application."
10. "If you are refactoring a module, ensure that it follows the Open/Closed Principle, allowing for extension without modification."
11. "If you are refactoring a file, ensure that it is well-organized and follows a consistent naming convention."
